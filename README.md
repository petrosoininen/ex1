Interview challenge
===

We'd love to see how you work when facing a little challenge.

**Create** a layout and functionality similar to the example in this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_KTnweaxs).

The menu open/close transitions should be **butter smooth also on modern mobile devices**.

**Bonus points** for optimizing touch input delay when opening the menu and implementing drag/flick gesture handling for opening and closing the menu.

You have 60 minutes and this GIT repo at your disposal.
